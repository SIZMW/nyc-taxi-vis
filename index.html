          The <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/home/home.shtml">New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commision</a> has overseen standard and for-hire taxis in the city of New York sinces its creation in 1971. These taxis have been used as a primary means of travel for many of the residents traveling in or out of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of years, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commision has aggregated millions of records of data about the taxis and the trips they make across the city. The data for <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/industry/yellow_taxi.shtml">Yellow Taxis</a> has been aggregated since 2009, <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/shl_passenger.shtml">Green Taxis</a> since mid-2013, and <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/industry/for_hire.shtml">For Hire Vehicles</a> since 2015.

          This information includes specifics such as passenger pickup and drop off times, start and destination locations of trips, costs and prices of the trips, and even tips and payment types.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided to take a look at this publicly available data and present a visualization that provides some insight into how taxis are used and operate in NYC. Our goal with this visualization is to present the data in a way that helps taxi drivers and taxi passengers understand taxi trip times, costs for using taxis, and the importance of taxis in various areas around the city.
